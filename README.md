# CentralAPI

How to run
---------------------------------------
1. Insert your sql server connection string in appsettings.json, inside the connection string section "YOUR CONNECTION STRING"
2. Run the Central API app along with web forms and complaintsApp and perform actions needed.

Considerations
--------------------------------------
I have not worked with identity before but tried to implement it, I ultimately could not integrate it into the apps but I have left the code I was busy with commented out for you to view how i wanted to go about it. The rest of the apps functionalities are working however. User is able to create players, view players in a team, create teams, create complaints, view all complaints and view a specific complaint.
Seed data was also added to give db data on startup
